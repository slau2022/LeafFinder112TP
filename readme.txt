Q: What is Leaf Finder?

An application that helps user learn more about trees by allowing them to browse tree species by different categories. After learning about some trees, users can switch to map to plan out a walk through Tompkins Square Park in order to see the trees they just learned about in real life!

Q: How do I do I run the project?

Make sure you've installed the following modules:

$ pip install beautifulsoup4
$ pip in stall Pillow

Download Leaf Finder from GitHub (https://github.com/slau2022/LeafFinder112TP) and run the "BrowserAndPathFinder.py" file!

Wait a couple seconds for the application to run. This project uses a lot of web scraping and may take a while to run since it needs to completing some initialization functions before popping up.
